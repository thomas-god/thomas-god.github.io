During the last 2 months I've spend around 250 hours learning Rust, this is my
journey.

_Context: software engineer with 7 years of experience writing backend services
in Python and Node/TS. DDD and hexagonal architecture, TDD and all the good
stuff._

Why learning Rust ?

- powerful type system, built in the language
- good DX, battery included
- something "new" to challenge my current conception
- as bonus, a language that could be used for embedded development.

My previous "attempts": read the rust book and done the rustlings exercises.

- (re)reading the rust book
- trying to program a RPI zero micro controller
- starting the Redis challenge from Codecrafters
- Reading Rust for Rustaceans
- Finishing my (simple) embedded project
- Decrusting tokio, the actor pattern and finishing the redis challenge

What i love about the language:

- the type system (ouf, what i came for) and the powerful syntax to support it
  (match, let/if let, the ? operator)
- the overall DX: cargo, compiler error messages, clippy
- the way rust "does OOP" (no inheritence and emphasis on composition with its
  trait system)
- the overall ecosystem for embedded development (HAL, embassy)
- the quality of the resources

What i disliked during my learning journey or about the language:
